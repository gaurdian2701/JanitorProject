# JanitorProject
Repo for a small personal 2D platformer project of mine.
I created all the assets from scratch using Aseprite software.

I have merged everything into the main branch.
All the Scripts are found in the Assets/Scripts folder.

- Env folder:- contains scripts for environmental objects that are utilized for platforming such as the toilet shooter, moving platforms, etc.
- Mobs folder:- contains only one Mob i.e. the Robot Mob, which contains State Machine scripts for the mob.
- ObjectPooling folder:- contains scripts which are mentioned in the Object Pooling architecture in the work sample document.
- Player folder:- contains scripts for the Player, sucking and shooting.
- Scriptable Objects folder:- contains scripts for the Scriptable Objects and the scriptable objects themselves.
- Suckable Objects folder:- contains the State Machine scripts for the suckable objects.
- UI folder:- contains scripts for UI.
- Utilities folder:- contains scripts for things like Levels, Events, and other stuff.
